# WFRP4e - Endeavours
This module adds a macro for the GMs to ask their players which endeavours they will undertake (if any), mainly focused in helping the GMs keep track of the chosen endeavours.

Based in the module [PF2e Exploration Activities](https://github.com/IcyLemonZ/pf2e-exploration-activities).

Available in English and Spanish.

## Instructions
Activate the module and import the macro into your world. You don't have to import the items.

Select the token(s) that can make endeavours and execute the macro. The player(s) will be prompted to select an endeavour:

- **Select**: The character will do the selected endeavour.

- **Other**: Change between "Between adventures" and "Travel" endeavours.

- **None**: The character won't do any endeavour.

A chat card will appear with the desired endeavour. If chosen a "Between adventures" endeavour, it will show a journal link (v10 journal pages). Not available yet for "Travel" endeavours.

Some endeavours have one or more items appearing in the chat card. The GM or the player can drag it to the character sheet and a roll dialog will show. As the GM, class or other can change the difficulty or modifiers, you can edit this dialog if needed.

An extra message will show in the result card for extra flavor.

## Extra Endeavours
Since version 1.1.0 there is a module settings menu for GMs where they can select extra endeavours from Altdorf: Crown of the Empire and Patrons of the Old World I & II.

GMs can consider this as "unlocking" these endeavours if the PCs are in Altdorf or met these patrons.

## Contributions
Only the Core Module Between Adventures endeavours have journal links included, If you want to contribute and have Enemy in Shadows, Altdorf: Crown of the Empire and/or Old World Bundle I, you can help me with the rest of the endeavours.
