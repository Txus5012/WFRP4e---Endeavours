# WFRP4e - Endeavours
This module adds a macro for the GMs to ask their players which endeavours they will undertake (if any), mainly focused in helping the GMs keep track of the chosen endeavours.

Based in the module [PF2e Exploration Activities](https://github.com/IcyLemonZ/pf2e-exploration-activities).

Available in English and Spanish.

## Instructions
Activate the module and import the macro into your world. You don't have to import the items.

Select the token(s) that can make endeavours and execute the macro. The player(s) will be prompted to select an endeavour:

- **Select**: The character will do the selected endeavour.

- **Other**: Change between "Between adventures" and "Travel" endeavours.

- **None**: The character won't do any endeavour.

A chat card will appear with the desired endeavour. If chosen a "Between adventures" endeavour, it will show a journal link (v10 journal pages). Not available yet for "Travel" endeavours.

Some endeavours have one or more items appearing in the chat card. The GM or the player can drag it to the character sheet and a roll dialog will show. As the GM, class or other can change the difficulty or modifiers, you can edit this dialog if needed.

An extra message will show in the result card for extra flavor.
